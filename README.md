# Bunkers #
<p>This is a high-performance, open-source remake of FrozenOrb's popular game-mode 
of the same name. This plugin is currently not in use on any networks and as 
such updates and bug fixes may be far and few between. Reporting issues and making
pull-requests is always welcome.</p>
 
## Compilation ##
Compilation requires the following be fulfilled: 

* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)

Once these tasks have been taken care of, compilation via `mvn clean install` will result in `/target/Bunkers.jar` being created.
